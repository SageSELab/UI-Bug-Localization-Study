# How to build/run?

1. Install JDK 11+ and Apache Maven. Add both JDK and Maven to your PATH environment variable.

2. Clone the following repos (found in my account) within the same directory:
* appcore
* text-analyzer
* code_search_ir (this one)

3. Modify the code_search_ir/build_run.bat script according to your environment. If you use Mac or Linux, you can create a similar script (for Bash or Zsh).

4. Run the script. If everything is ok, you shouldn't have any errors and the program should build/run successfully.
