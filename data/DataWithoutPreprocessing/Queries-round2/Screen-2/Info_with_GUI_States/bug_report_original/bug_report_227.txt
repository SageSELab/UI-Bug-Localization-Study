New transaction is not saved correctly (sign issue)

Steps to reproduce the behaviour

1. In an account (type bank) add a new transaction using the orange button.
2. type any amount you like (eg 10000 as deposit, the sign changes and the number becomes red)
3. Choose an account which has the type "expense"
4. Save
5. Go back to the account overview.

Expected behaviour

The amount has been substracted.

Actual behaviour

The amount has been added.

Funfact: It seems to work correct when hitting "split" after step 3. and then hitting "save" twice
It occurred with the last update on google-play a few days ago. No issues in previous version.
