[BUG] Unable to change label size when printing to Zebra printer

After adding a trait in the "Zebra Label Print" format we are unable to change the label size. When collecting data, the drop-down menus for Text, Barcode and Copies are also not available.

To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Create a trait with the "Zebra Label Print" format
2. Select "Zebra Label Print" trait for scoring
3. Go to "Collect" and move to "Zebra Label Print" trait
4. Scroll down for label details

Expected behavior
A dropdown menu should appear with multiple label size options or it should be possible to enter the label size manually.

Device Info (please complete the following information):

Model: [Zebra MC3300]
OS: [e.g. Android 7.1.2]
Field Book Version [4.3.3]
We are able to print on labels of 10 cm by 5 cm using the standard size of "3" x 2" simple".
