Artist's names missing - all over the app

Describe the bug
I only started using this app recently so I don't know when this issue occured first time. On any list in the app there are no artist names present. Not even in the artist tab - there are song names listed there instead.

Music app from MaxFour and also Phonograph that are obviously based on similar core doesn't have this problem. Artist's names are well seen anywhere around.

To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Open app
2. Try to spot some artist anywhere
3. They're never written anywhere
