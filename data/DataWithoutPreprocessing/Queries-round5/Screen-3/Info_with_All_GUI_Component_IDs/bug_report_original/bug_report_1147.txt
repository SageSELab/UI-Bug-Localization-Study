Nav drawer selection color for dark theme isn't right

Summary:
The current selection color for the navigation drawer selected item (e.g., "Status" when the status screen is shown) should be darker - it's currently not set as part of the Dark theme (i.e., navdrawer_background_color_selected_dark isn't used).

This boils down to trying to set the Theme/Style dynamically on the layout for the nav drawer item, and I haven't gotten this working yet.

WIP branch at https://github.com/barbeau/gpstest/tree/nav-drawer-dark-selected.

Here's the main code:
        if (Application.getPrefs().getBoolean(getString(R.string.pref_key_dark_theme), false)
                && layoutToInflate == R.layout.navdrawer_item) {
            // Dark theme
            Context context = new ContextThemeWrapper(getActivity(), R.style.NavDrawerListItem_Dark);
            LayoutInflater layoutInflater = getActivity().getLayoutInflater().cloneInContext(context);
            view = layoutInflater.inflate(layoutToInflate, container, false);
        } else {
            // Light theme
            view = getActivity().getLayoutInflater().inflate(layoutToInflate, container, false);
        }
        
It currently looks like the below, with only the area immediately surrounding the icon and text being black, the rest being navdrawer_background_color_selected_light, which is the color for the light style set in the XML:

Steps to reproduce:
1. Enable Dark theme via Settings
2. Open navigation drawer

Expected behavior:
Selected item in navigation drawer should have a darker highlighted color to make it easier to see (i.e., should use navdrawer_background_color_selected_dark.

Observed behavior:
The lighter navdrawer_background_color_selected_light color is used for the selected item

Device and Android version:
Samsung Galaxy S8+ w/ Android 8.0 beta
