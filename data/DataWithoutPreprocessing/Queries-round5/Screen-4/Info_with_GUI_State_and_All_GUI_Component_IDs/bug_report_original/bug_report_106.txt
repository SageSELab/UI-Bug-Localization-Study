unable to play from folder view since 0.21.0

Describe the bug
Since I installed the latest update 0.21.0, I am unable to play media from the folder view. Touching a song has no effect, neither has selecting the song by long pressing and then using "add to playlist" or by using the song menu and selecting "play next". This is reproducible on all of my songs, all of which used to work before the update.
Notably, the library view is not affected (everything works as expected there, tried the same songs), only the folder view.
I have reinstalled the app as well to no effect.

To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Go to folder view
2. Try to play any song by any means provided by the app

Expected behavior
The song would play.
