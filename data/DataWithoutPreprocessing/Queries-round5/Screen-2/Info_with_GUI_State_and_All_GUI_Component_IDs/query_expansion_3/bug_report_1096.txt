Going back while recording sound causes endless loading (or crash)

Pixel 3

Create new observation
Record a sound
record the sound
Don't press done, but go back (eg because the sound was not good and you want to re-record)
try to record a new sound
press done
get an endless Loading screen
unable to go back
have to force close iNat app

Same issue if you have an existing observation
Record a sound, but don't press done, just go back to re-record.
Record the sound, press done, and endless Loading screen.

Note that I believe she is using the built-in sound recorder. There are some large crash logs in slack: https://inaturalist.slack.com/archives/G041A2Z1W/p1571388239011300

When I try to replicate given the steps above (on a Pixel 3), I just get a crash immediately after tapping the back button in the left side of the header.
