Snackbar Disappears During Auto-Upload

Steps to reproduce bug:
1. Create an observation (preferably with a lot of photos)
2. When in the ob list view, tap "Stop"
3. Notice the "Resume" button and snackbar are present for a few seconds and then disappear. The obs are left in "Waiting to Upload..." state without a way to upload them. Even going to other sections of the app and coming back to not initiate uploads.

Expected Behavior
After tapping "Stop" the snackbar and "Resume" button remain there until "Resume" is tapped. This means tapping "Stop" is sort of like turning off auto-upload, except tapping "Resume" turns auto-upload on again.
