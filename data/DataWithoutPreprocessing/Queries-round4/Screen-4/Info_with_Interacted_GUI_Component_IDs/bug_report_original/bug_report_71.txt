Favorites bar doesn't appear under specific UI settings

Describe the bug
After updating to a newer version of KISS launcher, I am no longer able to make the shortcut bar appear. The cause seems to be the "Hide favorites bar initially" setting. When enabled, the favorites bar will not appear when I try to tap on the screen. When disabled, the favorites bar will stay present and not disappear until the search bar or the KISS button is pressed.

To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Set an app as a favorite.
2. Enable "Show favorites above search bar" under Favorites settings.
3. Enable Minimalistic UI under User experience.
4. Enable "Hide favorites bar initially" under Minimalistic UI.
5. Check home screen to see there is no favorites bar, even after tapping the screen.

Expected behavior
Previously, I had set up KISS launcher to display my favorites bar when I tapped anywhere on the main screen. Now, I can't make the favorites bar appear at all without changing my settings.
