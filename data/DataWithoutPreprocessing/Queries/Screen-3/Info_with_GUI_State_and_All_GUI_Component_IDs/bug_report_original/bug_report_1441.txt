Issue manually entering fishing spot coordinates

Problem
If the "sync" icon isn't clicked after manually entering coordinates, the fishing spot's coordinates aren't updated accordingly.

Reproduction steps
1. Create a new, or edit an existing location
2. Add fishing spot
3. Manually enter coordinates (do not click the sync button)
4. Save
5. In the edit location screen the coordinates are not correct

Solution
The add fishing spot screen should get and validate its coordinates from the TextView widgets, not the middle of the map. If the coordinates are invalid, the user should see a dialog (this may already be implemented).
