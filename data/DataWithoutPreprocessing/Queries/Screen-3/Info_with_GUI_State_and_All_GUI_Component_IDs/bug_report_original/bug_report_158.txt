Dark mode not correctly setting theme colors in card area of Reviewer

Reproduction Steps

Switch on Night Mode.
It doesn't matter if one sets the Theme to "Dark" or "Black".
Card background is always 100% black.

Pure black backgrounds should be avoided from an UX perspective. It increases eyestrain and decreases legibility.

I suggest that the card background should be toned down a bit.
