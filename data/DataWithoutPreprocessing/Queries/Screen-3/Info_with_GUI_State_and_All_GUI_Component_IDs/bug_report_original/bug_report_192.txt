Cursor position reset when switching away from app

Version

v0.2.4 from F-Droid

Steps to replicate

1. Open a (preferably big) file and enter edit mode
2. Move the cursor to any place other than the initial position
3. Switch to another app and switch back

Expected behavior

Cursor remains where you placed it.

Actual behavior

Cursor goes back to the initial position.

This happens even when one has opened e.g. the insert image dialog. If you insert the image after switching back, it'll be inserted at the beginning of the file.
