Keep scroll position when adding files to op context/reloading current directory

Describe the bug
When reloading the current directory after completing a file operation, the list scrolls to the top (obviously because it's reinitialized). We need to save the scroll position before triggering a reload/save it on scroll/after scroll?

To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Go to any folder with a long enough list to scroll
2. Mark any file at the bottom for any operation
3. Scroll moves back up

Expected behavior
Current scroll position should be preserved.
