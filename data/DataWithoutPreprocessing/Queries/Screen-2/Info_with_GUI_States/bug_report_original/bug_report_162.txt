Crashes with invalid format email address

Expected behavior

I want to use an internal email adress like "foo@b.2". We use some custom software on our own servers only for internal communication. It works in Thunderbird.

Actual behavior

(All messages and texts are in german on my device; I don't know the texts if you use K9 in english. I just tried to translate them)
If I try to add a new email account to K9-Mail (Enter email and password) and tap on one of the two buttons ("Manually" or "Continue") the app will crash with only the message "K-9 Mail has stopped"

Steps to reproduce

1. Open K-9 Mail
2. Add new email account with "foo@b.2"
3. Press "Manually" or "Continue"
4. Crash

Environment

K-9 Mail version: 5.403

Android version: 6.0.1

Account type (IMAP, POP3, WebDAV/Exchange): I WANT to use IMAP, but I haven't tried yet, because of the crash.
