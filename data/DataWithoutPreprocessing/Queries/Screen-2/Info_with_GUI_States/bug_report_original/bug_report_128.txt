Switching language is not working.

General information
App version: 0.7.1.1
App source: GitHub
Android Version: 6

Expected result

What is expected?
When switching language, the UI should display the right language

What does happen instead?
The app is falling back to english

Steps to reproduce
I think that the app should use values-ar values-fr etc instead of the regionalized values-rLangRegion
