Crash after deleting a program that is in progress

If you start a program, then go to delete it without first stopping it, then the next time you go back into "Workout" the application will crash. It will be stuck in a crash loop.

To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Create a test program with any exercise.
2. Go to Workout -> Program, select your new program and click "Start Program".
3. Go to Program list, select your test program and delete it.
4. Go back to Workout. The application will crash.

Expected behavior
If a workout that is in progress gets deleted, simply stop it.

Additional context
I reproduced this one while playing around a bit. It looks like when you go back into the Workout page, there is a refresh that happens and it is trying to access a Program that does not exist anymore. Problem is that even if the program was deleted, it is still inside the mDbWorkoutHistory and set as running.

I can look into this and fix it, it will help me familiarize myself with the code.
