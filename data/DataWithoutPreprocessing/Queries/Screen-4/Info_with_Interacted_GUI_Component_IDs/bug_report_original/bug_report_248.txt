Accessing General settings form Admin settings does not display disabled submenus

Software and hardware versions

Collect v1.20.0, Android v9 build number 00WW_5_140, device used Nokia 8 TA-1004

Problem description

Accessing General settings from Admin settings does not display all General settings submenus if access to them has been revoked from normal users.

When normal user access for all settings has been disabled, only the following submenu items are available in admin mode:

1. Server Settings -> ODK Aggregate settings
2. Form management -> Form filling -> Show guidance for questions

Steps to reproduce the problem

1. In Admin Settings -> User Settings, uncheck all check boxes
2. Check available settings in Admin Settings -> General Settings -> Server
3. Check available settings in Admin Settings -> General Settings -> User interface
4. Check available settings in Admin Settings -> General Settings -> Form management
5. Check available settings in Admin Settings -> General Settings -> User and device identity

Expected behavior

Accessing General settings via the Admin settings should allow access to all the settings in General settings submenus.

Other information

Class org.odk.collect.android.preferences.DisabledPreferencesRemover does not seem to take into account whether the user is in admin mode or not.

Class org.odk.collect.android.preferences.GeneralPreferencesFragment handles admin mode correctly for main General settings categories.
