Onboarding issues: Third "Let's get started" slide show the wrong encryption method

General information
App version: 0.6.3.1-play
App source: Google Play
Android Version: 8.0.0
Custom ROM: Samsung

Expected result
The first slide says "read carefully", so I did. I left the second slide unchanged (the dropdown defaulted to "Password / PIN"). On the third slide the text said

Since you have chosen Android KeyStore as encryption method this is optional.

which got me confused. The dropdown on the third slide has "None" and "Device credentials" greyed out, so I guess the text is just a UI bug. I went back to the second slide and double checked, it still says "Password / PIN". Selecting "Android KeyStore" and then back to "Password / PIN" updates the text on the third slide.

However, here's a second issue: if I explicitly select "Android KeyStore" then the third slide still has a red text saying "Please set a password to continue". Which is odd, because the text at the top says "Since you have chosen Android KeyStore as encryption method this is optional.". But the red text indicates it is not optional. I think this is just a UX bug and an unfortunate coincidence that "Password" is still the default even though "Android KeyStore" was selected. Maybe it should default to "None" to align with what the text says?

Steps to reproduce
Read carefully what the onboarding screens say. I still haven't finished the onboarding and can reproduce the behavior every single time I open the app and restart the process.
