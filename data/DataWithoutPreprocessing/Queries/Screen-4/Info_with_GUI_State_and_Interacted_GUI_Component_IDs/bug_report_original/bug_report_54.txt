Save button makes the file not save

Description

Steps to reproduce the bug:

1. Press + to create a new note.
2. Enter title and some content
3. Wait for the save icon to be enabled (it is grayed out at start)
4. Press save icon
5. Press the back arrow from top
6. Note is NOT created

The note creation works if I skip steps 3 and 4 and only just press the back arrow. If I wait then the note is not created.
