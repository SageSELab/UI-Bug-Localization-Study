File URI support detection overly strict

Describe the bug
External storage cannot be written to on Fire OS 5 (based on Android 5.1 Lollipop LOLLIPOP_MR1), despite Storage Access Framework (SAF) subtree support being added in 5.0 LOLLIPOP. This is caused by at least these two checks:

These gate URI mounting on Marshmallow M (23), while they should gate on Lollipop LOLLIPOP (21).

Additionally, while searching around for this issue, I noticed that use of straight numbers and Build.VERSION_CODES enum members is inconsistent, and it might be easier to correct checks like this if VERSION_CODES.* is consistently used (vs. grepping for straight 23).

To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior on Android 5.1 (API level 22 / LOLLIPOP_MR1):

1. Open file browser.
2. Tap on â‹¯ menu.
3. Observe lack of "Mount folder" menu item.

Expected behavior
Mount folder should be available, as it works on this platform (e.g. it's available and functioning with Ghost Commander's SAF browser).
