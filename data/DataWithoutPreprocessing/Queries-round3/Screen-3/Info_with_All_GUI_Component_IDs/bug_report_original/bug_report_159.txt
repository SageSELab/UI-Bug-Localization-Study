Crash in Card Browser, the multi-select mode: Edit => change the card type

Reproduction Steps

1. Create any type and clone it (to keep things simple, I've just used basic, calling the types "Basic 1" & "Basic 2").
2. Add two cards to the first type.
3. Browser → select the two new cards → Edit → try to change the type (in my case, "Basic 1" → "Basic 2").

Expected Result

If you could allow there some sort of batch type reassignment via the default field mapping, that would be perfect!

Actual Result

It crashes, only the first card is affected by the change.
