Undo with last list item does not work

App version: develop
Android version: LineageOS 16
Device model: OnePlus 3T
First occured: Not sure. Was there before the empty view rework in #3060

Expected behaviour:
Undo snackar action should work

Current behaviour:
Undo action does not work when the item is the only one in the list. Empty view is removed and list is displayed. List contains an item (layout inspector), but it seems to be moved outside of the screen. Affected: Queue, Episodes->New, Episodes->Favorites

Steps to reproduce:

1. Remove all items except one from queue
2. Swipe out
3. Press "Undo"  MainActivity QueueFragment action_bar_root content drawer_layout toolbar queue_lock refresh_item main_view info_bar divider recyclerView container drag_handle imgvCover txtvTitle txtvPubDate bottom_bar txtvProgressLeft txtvProgressRight butSecondaryAction statusBarBackground navigationBarBackground empty
