[BUG] Categories are displayed off the screen

Hi, thank you so much for the active development of this amazing tool.

Describe the bug
The categories of a categorical trait are displayed off-screen, especially if they are large words or multiple words. This does not happen if the format of the trait is changed to "multicat".

Looks like there is a fixed number of 3 categories per line with the "categorical" format. With the "multicat" the different categories are fitted to the screen on a variable number per line.

To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Create two categorical traits, with several categories (15+ characters long each)
2. One trait select "categorical" format, the other trait select "multicat"
3. Go to collect and see the difference on how categories are displayed

Expected behavior
Expected different categories from "categorical" format traits to be displayed as those from "multicat" format, i.e. fitted to screen.
