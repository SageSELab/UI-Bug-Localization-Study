Summary:

The language of the "Help->About" screen isn't currently affected by the "Setting->Language" setting.

Steps to reproduce:

2. Change to another language in GPSTest via ""Setting->Language" (e.g., Spanish)
3. In the nav drawer, go to "Help->About"

Expected behavior:

The "Help->About" screen should show up in the language selected in GPSTest settings.

Observed behavior:

The "Help->About" screen is shown in the Android system settings language and ignores the GPSTest language setting.
