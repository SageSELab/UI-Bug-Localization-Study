Can't enter negative sign for lat/lon/alt in Accuracy view

Describe the bug
In Accuracy view, if you type a negative sign into the latitude, longitude, or altitude text boxes, nothing happens (no negative signs are added).

I think the changes in #389 broke this.

Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to Accuracy view
2. Tap on fields for latitude, longitude, or altitude
3. Type -

Expected behavior
- should appear in the text box

Observed behavior
Nothing appears in the text box
