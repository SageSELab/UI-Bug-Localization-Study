Confirmation field in settings doesn't react to show password option

General information

App version: master
App source: GitHub
Android Version: 29
Custom ROM: None (emulator)

Steps to reproduce

1. Open app.
2. Open Settings.
3. Tap "Authentication" to open dialog.
4. Enter new PIN/Password into both fields, and tap the "password visibility" option

Expected result

What is expected?
Password/PIN shows in both fields

What does happen instead?
Password/PIN shows only in the main field, not the confirm field.

I added a similar fix for #580 for the introductory Password/PIN setting, so I'll port that over here as well.
