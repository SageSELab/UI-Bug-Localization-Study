Autolock doesn't work anymore

Info

Version: 1.0.1
Source: Google Play
Vault encrypted: Yes (no fingerprint unlock)
Android version and ROM: 7.0

Steps to reproduce

1. unlock the vault
2. push home button (not back button)
3. launch Aegis again

What do you expect to happen?

It should auto-lock (it used to work perfectly with previous version 0.4.3)

What happens instead?

Shows a message "Vault is unlocked. Tap here to lock." but doesn't lock the vault automatically.

I'm not sure if it's a bug but I preferred the old version where the vault closed automatically. If Aegis is not in the foreground, I want it to lock itself.
