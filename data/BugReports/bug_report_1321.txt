Aegis doesn't respect user's animation settings

Info

Version: v1.1.1

Steps to reproduce

1. Go into your Android settings and disable animations
2. Open Aegis
3. Unlock vault

What do you expect to happen?

No animations in the timer, acitivty transitions and recyclerview update.

What happens instead?

There are still animations because Aegis overrides the user settings.

Animations check

We can read the flags:
TRANSITION_ANIMATION_SCALE
WINDOW_ANIMATION_SCALE

If they are 0, then animations are disabled.
